# CoronaVirus-Analysis
Without knowing much about the news on the corona virus. I got some insight from the dataset released by John-Hopkins hospital on the spread of the virus. 

The major deductions were:
1) China undoubtedly has the highest cases of the virus(confirmed, death, recovered)
2) Other countries have had higher recovery rates than China and less death cases
3) The virus spread seems to be increasing by the day with showing little signs of decline.
